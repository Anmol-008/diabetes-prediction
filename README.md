# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a person has diabetes based on medical parameters using a machine learning model.

## 📂 Dataset
- File: `diabetes.csv`
- Contains health-related features such as glucose level, BMI, age, etc.

## 🧠 Model Used
- Machine Learning classification model
- Model is trained and saved as `model.pkl`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`
3. Run all cells in order

## 📊 Output
The model predicts whether the patient is diabetic or not based on input features.
