# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical and health-related parameters.  
A machine learning classification model is trained on historical patient data and used to make predictions.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow:
- Data loading
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Prediction using a saved model
